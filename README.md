each customer’s name, address, phone number, email.

customer or an authorized family member. Family members are registered to a customer for
pickup permission which allows them to access their family’s dog(s) at the salon.

information is tracked by product number and the product description such as shampoo, styling
tools, bows, nail clippers, combs, and other similar items.

are tracked by type and description of service. The Salon wants to track which products are used
for which service so they can be efficient in product ordering. Some services use no products,
while other services may use more than one. A product may have multiple uses for different
services. They also want to track which employees provide which services to which dogs on
which dates. Services offered such as washes, haircuts, hair styles, nail trimming, nail painting,
